# SnowBlower

## Objectives
Use ICESat-2 data to gain an understanding of the relationship between blowing snow and environmental conditions. Interpret ICESat-2 blowing snow flags and perhaps develop a better algorithm for creating these flags. Combine data to create spatial maps if possible.

## Datasets

## Is there a template?
