## Science Questions

How do ICESat-2 blowing snow statistics depend on environmental conditions?

What is the sensitivity of the blowing snow algorithm. Can we identify false positives?

What is the spatial variability of the ICESat-2 blowing snow events?

## Technical Goals

Develop a blowing snow product. Can we make a gridded climatology for high latitudes?
