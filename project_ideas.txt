The purpose of this document is to serve as a list of ideas, to do tasks, problems, etc.

Eric:
	To Do:
		- Retrieve binary (yes or no) or confidence level (high, medium, low)
		timestamped and geolocated arrays on the occurence of blowing snow. 

		- Retrieve regional climate model (RACMO or MAR for land ice, for sea ice???)
		that quantifies blowing snow.

		- Retrieve reanalysis (MERRA-2, ERA-Interim, ERA-5) for air temperature, 
		wind speeds, snowdepth, etc. 
	Ideas:
		- Compare IceSAT-2 blowing snow to regional cliamte models and reanalysis
		data sets. 
		
		- Develop routines such that they can be generalized to any point of interest. 

		- Would be interesting to look along the 88 degrees south line of latitude as 
		there are many IS-2 tracks already available then. 

	Problems:
